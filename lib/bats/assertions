# Assertions for Bats tests
#
# Provides detailed output for assertion failures, which is especially helpful
# when running as part of a continuous integration suite.
#
# The recommended way to make these assertions available is to create an
# 'environment.bash' file in the top-level test directory containing the
# following line:
#
#   . "path/to/bats/assertions"
#
# Then have each Bats test file load the environment file. This environment file
# can contain any other custom helper functions or assertions to fit your
# project.
#
# If none of the assertions suit your needs, you can use the fail() function to
# provide a custom error message. For example, to validate that the command
# output does _not_ match a regular expression:
#
#   local pattern="what is this i don't even"
#   if [[ "$output" =~ $pattern ]]; then
#     fail "output should not match: '$pattern'"
#   fi
#
# Alternatively, write your own assertion functions that call the following
# before returning:
#
#   set +o functrace
#   trap "bats_assertion_return_trap '$BASH_SOURCE'" RETURN
#
# See the comment for `bats_assertion_return_trap` for more details.
#
# The assertions borrow inspiration from rbenv/test/test_helper.bash.

# Unconditionally returns a failing status
#
# Will print an optional failure reason, the Bats 'run' command exit status, and
# the output from the 'run' command, all to standard error.

# Scrubs the Bats stacks of functions from the assertion source file
#
# This helps ensure that Bats failure messages only contain the location at
# which an assertion was called, rather than containing stack trace information
# about the assertion implementation itself.
#
# You must ensure that `set +o functrace` is in effect prior to calling this
# function. Usually you'll do this by making these the first two lines of your
# assertion function, or by adding them just before returning an error value (if
# you accumulate multiple assertion errors in one function, since each assertion
# may reset `set -e functrace`):
#
#   set +o functrace
#   trap "bats_assertion_return_trap '$BASH_SOURCE'" RETURN
#
# Or, if you have a shared implementation function, call `set +o functrace` at
# the beginning of each public-facing function, and set the trap in the
# implementation function, as with __assert_output and __assert_line.
#
# Background
# ----------
# Bats sets 'functrace' to make sure failing commands are pinpointed. This is
# almost always the desired behavior, except that we don't actually want a stack
# trace showing assertion implementation details. When it does, it produces a
# bit of mental overhead when reviewing test failures to identify the location
# of the failing assertion in the test case itself.
#
# Notice that each public assertion function starts with 'set +o functrace', and
# this function ends with 'set -o functrace'. However, just calling 'set +o
# functrace' still leaves the function, file, and line number where the
# assertion was defined in the Bats failure output. Plus, we want to ensure that
# 'set -o functrace' goes back into effect once the assertion has finished.
#
# Arguments:
#   $1:  The $BASH_SOURCE value from the assertion source file
